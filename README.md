# Surf's Up
## Overview: 
The client requested a climate analysis of the island of Oahu inorder to decide on investing in a combination surf shop/ ice cream shop. The analysis includes visualizations of precipitation across a year, active weather stations, as well as a web app that displays weather statistics. Finally, temperature statistics for the months of June and December were delivered at the clients request.

## Results: 
(reference: Resources/june_temps.png, Resources/december_temps.png)
  - The average temperature reading for both months are only 4˚F apart with the average for June observations being 75˚F, and the average for December observations being 71˚F.
  - The minimum temperature observations for both months have a variance of 8˚F, with the minimum observation of June being 64˚F, and the minimum observation of December being 56˚F.
  - The maximum temperature observations of the two months have a difference of 2˚F, with the maximum temperature observation for June being 85˚F, and the maximum temperature observation of December being 83˚F.

## Summary:
There was a very slight difference between the statistics of the temperature observations of the two months. The average observations only differed by 4˚F, the minimum observation only differed by 8˚F, and the maximum observations only differed by 2˚F.

Some additional queries that may provide some more insight to the year-round climate of the island are: 
  - querying for descriptive statistics of precipitation for the two months, and
  - querying the descriptive statistics for both temperature and precipitation in relation to the location of the weather station it was measured at. This may showcase the most ideal location with regards to climate.
